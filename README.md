### install all the imports
go mod tidy

### run the app (assuming u are in the main repo)
go run cmd/api/main.go 

### rememeber to capitalise stuff that you want to import from other packages
### look at the get all applicants thing again see how to maybe make it more readable

### assumptions
The sample data given doesnt show applicant with marital status, so I handled it in the create new applicant function.
